To design a new software system like a master in 2026, you must stop thinking about "code" and start thinking about Data Flow and Business Rules. This process is called System Modeling.
Here is the professional 5-step framework to plan a new software with unknown entities:
1. The Discovery Phase: "Nouns and Verbs"
Take a pen and paper. Describe the business process in plain English.
Identify Nouns (Your Entities): These are the things the system tracks.
Example: Product, Customer, Order, Discount, ShippingManifest.
Identify Verbs (Your Logic): These are the actions the system performs.
Example: PlaceOrder, UpdateStock, ApplyDiscount, TrackShipment.
2. Define Entity Relationships (ERD)
Once you have your nouns, decide how they talk to each other. In .NET, this determines how you configure Entity Framework Core.
One-to-One: A Customer has one Wallet.
One-to-Many: A Product has many Reviews.
Many-to-Many: A Product can be in many Categories, and a Category has many Products.
3. Draft the "Contract" (API Blueprint)
Before writing any logic, design the Request and Response. This is the most critical "Master" step.
Ask yourself: If I am the Mobile App, what data do I need to send to the server to create an Order?
Example for a new "Order" entity:
Request (Input): UserID, List of ProductIDs, ShippingAddress.
Response (Output): OrderID, TotalPrice, EstimatedDeliveryDate, Status.
4. Choose your Architectural Pattern
Since you are a master, you don't just put everything in one folder.
Clean Architecture (Recommended):
Domain Layer: Pure C# classes (Entities) with no logic.
Application Layer: Your "Verbs" (Logic). Interfaces for services.
Infrastructure: Database context, Redis, and External APIs.
API Layer: Controllers or Minimal APIs that handle the HTTP traffic.
5. The "Logic Flow" (The Secret of Seniors)
Before you write the C# code, write Pseudo-code (English code) for your most complex process.
Process: Placing an Order
Check if the user exists in DB.
Check if all items are in stock.
Calculate total price + tax.
Call Payment Gateway.
If payment fails, return error.
If payment succeeds, create Order record and reduce Stock.
Send confirmation email.
Why this works for 2026 E-commerce:
E-commerce is complex because it involves State Changes. A product isn't just "there"; it moves from InStock to Reserved to Sold. By planning these states before you code, you avoid "Spaghetti Code" where your logic gets tangled.
Action Task:
For your E-commerce project, take three entities: Product, User, and Order.
List 5 properties for each (e.g., Product.Price, User.Email).
Write down the "Verb" that connects them (e.g., "User places Order containing Products").
Once you have this plan, you are ready to write your first Migration in EF Core. Microsoft's System Design Guide is your best resource for visual examples of this planning.
